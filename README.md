# ftech-tts-project
This project implements a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system using Python, allowing users to generate speech from text for both English and regional languages (e.g., Hindi). The project uses the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library to convert input text into speech and save the generated audio as .mp3 files.
